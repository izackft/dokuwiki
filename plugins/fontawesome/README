FontAwesome Plugin for DokuWiki

Embed Font Awesome icons to your pages.

USAGE
=====

First, make FontAwesome available on your pages.
See http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/. This plugin does not
install FontAwesome automatically.
You can edit the template you're using.

To embed FontAwesome icons in your pages use the following syntax:
 - For FontAwesome < 4.0
    <faicon icon-phone>
 - For FontAweomse >= 4.0
    <faicon fa fa-phone>

The snippet would render the *-phone icon.

=====

All documentation for this plugin can be found at

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/fontawesome/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
